# Apex-Discord-Workout-Bot

Using version one of my discord speech to text bot.

This basically a meme project.

Assuming everything is ready to go. (you got you discord bot and your google cloud stuff running)

Get the bot to join your voice channel (!c).
Play an apex game.
When it's over say "game over".
Then the bot will give you your workout rutine for the match :).
(!dc) to disconnect the bot.

The bot will basically listen to you and make a workout rutine based on what you say.
Therefore, saying something like "He's on shot bro!!!!" will earn you 10 push ups.

I don't plan on working on this meme too much. I am much more interested in optimizing the actual speech to text bot.
However, I will occasionally comeback and fix and add some stuff.


Hope you have fun with this, or at least find it useful for your own tinkering :D.
